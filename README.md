# MyReads

This is my submission for Project "MyReads" @ Udacity

I created this project from scratch using vite react-ts template. Note that I use `bun` instead of `npm`, so please install bun at `bun.sh` for better web development experience.

## Local development

Run following commands to start local development:

```bash
# install the dependencies
bun i

# start dev server
bun dev
```

## Achievement

- Passed typecheck `bun typecheck` and there is no error.
